# Mengcp [re: me-nge-cap]
Random tools coded while learning and exploring MCP (Model Context Protocol) for building AI agents.

## Tools
### Code Editing Agent
Contains simple tools for code editing by AI agent using Claude (currently). It's based on the tutorial from [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) with slight modifications to the code structure and file organization for improved tidiness and performance.

- More modular code with organized file structure
- Performance optimizations in the code with map and in-memory cache for the definition setting

Feel free to explore and modify the code for your own purposes!

### Poke Agent
Inspired by [allenthomas](https://allenthomas.vercel.app/posts/mcp) technical walkthrough to explain what and how MCP works in simple terms.
