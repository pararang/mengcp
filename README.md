# Code Editing Agent

This repository contains a simple code editing agent using Claude (currently). It's based on the tutorial from [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) with slight modifications to the code structure and file organization for improved tidiness and performance.

- More modular codes with organized file structure
- Performance optimizations in the code with map and in-memory cache for the definition setting

Feel free to explore and modify the code for your own purposes!
