# Mengcp [re: me-nge-cap]
Random tools coded while learning and exploring MCP (Model Context Protocol) for building AI agents.

## Code Editing Agent
Contains a simple tools for code editing by AI agent using Claude (currently). It's based on the tutorial from [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) with slight modifications to the code structure and file organization for improved tidiness and performance.

- More modular codes with organized file structure
- Performance optimizations in the code with map and in-memory cache for the definition setting

Feel free to explore and modify the code for your own purposes!

## Poke Agent
Inspired from [allenthomas](https://allenthomas.vercel.app/posts/mcp) technical walkthrough to explain what and how MCP working in simple terms.
